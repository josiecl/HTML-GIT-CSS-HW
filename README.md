## Title: Horiseon Website Overhaul

Hello. My name is Josie Collins and I am the developer of the newly-overhauled Horiseon website. 

This assignment was not without its fair share of challenges. In fact, I ran into several; if I could count the number of times an image took up the whole screen, I would be counting for a very long time! However, through a great deal of perseverence and work, I was able to get the site to the standards I wanted. 

## What it does

This website provides information and images for online brand awareness. It includes information on social medias, reputation, and benefits to hosting a webpage to provide information on one's business. It also provides alternatives to the images, for accessibility, and it has a very user-friendly interface that makes navigating the site simple and easy to understand.


## Challenges Faced: Fixing Coding

First was the html. It was very simplistic, consisting of mostly 'div's. I took the time to convert these all to their respective semantic forms, and while this did temporarily impact the site's design, I was able to fix it by adapting the CSS. This also took some work, as the CSS corresponded to the prior 'div' commands. I tried to change the corresponding CSS tags whenever I converted the 'div's to semantics, so I wouldn't forget which styling went to which command. 

## Challenges Faced: Adding Accessibility

Another big issue for this site was that it was very lacking in accessibility. None of the images had any alternative texts to read, so I made one for each image in case the image fails to load, or someone who cannot see is using the website. It's important to stay accessible to all, so I'm glad I was able to fix this.

## Developer notes

The site I was given had no developer notes, which made navigating the html more difficult than necessary. To combat this, I made my own developer notes. They are simplistic in nature, in order to conserve space, but I feel they help make navigating the files a lot easier. I think they'll be useful to future developers. 

## What I learned

I discovered a lot of the semantic counterparts for 'div' commands. I also found how troubleshooting can be done quickly and effectively, and how to use my resources for assistance when needed. Overall, it was a very enriching experience that left me feeling a great deal more confident in my coding abilities.
